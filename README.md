# MiniCord

This is a project I'm currently doing for school. I tried remaking discord in 1 week but privacy and security focused, there was a lot of things missing including essential security related stuff and a more polished frontend because well it's quite impossible to recreate a privacy focused P2C messager in 1 week. But oh well I tried my best and spent around 100 hours in total in this project and an extra 20 hours making a report about it and preparing a presentation. I might come back to this project one day and oh well seeing this README would probably make me laugh.
